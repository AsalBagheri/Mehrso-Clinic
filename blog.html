                    <p>From the age of 12, in addition to brushing your teeth, it is recommended to use interdental brushes as part of your oral hygiene program. Some people may not have enough space between their teeth to use an interdental brush, so flossing can be a useful alternative. Your dental team or specialist can show you the best way to clean between your teeth. This standard floss is generally considered the most effective tool for cleaning tight spaces between teeth. You can also floss up and down the sides of each tooth.

Do not be too aggressive with the floss: it risks damaging the gums. The main action of flossing is to pull the teeth firmly but gently from top to bottom.

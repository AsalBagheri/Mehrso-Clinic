                <h3>Dental composite</h3>
                <p>If you have thought about changing your smile, dental composite can be a good choice for you. Dental composite and dental laminate are a kind of beauty treatment that you can use to have white and healthy teeth. They are thin, tooth-colored and made of special quality materials that are glued onto your teeth. Maintaining a beautiful smile does not always mean more brushing and flossing daily! Unfortunately, even with complete home care, teeth are subject to decay and other cosmetic issues. Regular dental check-ups can prevent these types of problems to some extent. But sometimes, it is not possible to fix the ugliness of the teeth with health care. Dental composite is one of the common suggestions of dentists to cover the imperfections of the teeth, for which you need to raise your level of awareness and preparation.</p>

                <h3>Dental restoration</h3>
                <p>A restorative dentist, in a dental office or clinic, is responsible for removing caries, compensating fractures, fixing discolored or deformed areas in the crown of teeth. The crown of the teeth can be restored with the same color material or "dental composite" or metal material or "amalgam". Dental crown restoration is also called "Filling" or "Filling" in popular terms.

                    Teeth may decay due to various reasons including lack of hygiene. Of course, other factors such as genetics, misalignment of teeth and improper nutrition are also effective in causing caries.
                  
                  When the tooth decays, its chemical composition changes, it becomes soft and loose, and it becomes a place for the accumulation of microbes. If not treated, the tooth will be destroyed and lost. The lower the loss of tooth tissue, the higher the success rate of tooth restoration and the lower the chance of caries recurrence</p>

                <h3>Dental implant</h3>
                <p>Dental implants are the best proven method to replace missing teeth. Most patients describe the implant treatment as comfortable and painless and they enjoy being able to eat, chew and swallow easily thanks to them. Deciding to use an implant is not always easy. After the patient's decision to fill the empty dental spaces, the dentist must evaluate all the conditions and suggest the best treatment plan based on the patient's needs. There are many factors, including the number of missing teeth, the strength of the jaw bone and the health of the surrounding teeth, the age of the patient, systemic diseases, the time of extraction of the previous teeth, etc., that must be considered; Each implant is designed for a specific application that is chosen according to your oral health status, comfort, budget and lifestyle.
                    Old dentures were one of the first methods used to replace missing teeth.</p>
